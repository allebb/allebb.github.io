# allebb.github.com

## What is this?

Just a place for me to store, version and auto-deploy my basic personal homepage from.

The production version of this 'site' can be viewed at: http://bobbyallen.me

Prior to deployment to GitHub, given that this site is hosted on GitHub pages, Gulp should be ran prior to committing and pushing changes; this can be achieved by typing:

```shell
gulp
```
